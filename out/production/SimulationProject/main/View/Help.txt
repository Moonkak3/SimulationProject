Welcome to Boids!
This is a program designed to simulate the behaviour of birds and bird flocking. Each bird follows 4 simple rules, alignment, coherence, separation, and collision-avoidance. Alignment is following the direction of adjacent birds, coherence is moving closer to the center of a flock, separation is equally distancing itself from adjacent birds, and collision-avoidance is avoiding walls as they will die if they crash into them.
Users can hover their cursor over the labels of each function to get a better understanding of what the functions do.
To get started, you can click the play button under the BOIDS SIMULATION TitledPane and the birds will start flying. However, birds flying in an empty space is quite boring. You can change how the birds behave in the BIRD SETTINGS TitledPane.
To make things even more interesting, you can change the map design itself under MAP SETTINGS! Start by setting a wall-spawn chance of around 60%. You should get something that looks like a QR code. Next, you can smoothen out the map by clicking the Smoothen button. I am using Cellular Automata for this process. Keep smoothening the map until you find it to be satisfactory. You can change the seed for the random function by clearing the text-field and hitting the Enter key, which changes how the walls are randomly spawned.
Users can also change the theme of the UI through the APPEARANCE TitledPane. There are 4 pre-set themes available for use. The color of the walls, background and birds in the main screen can be changed to be different from the theme.
If users wish to save the beautiful map, the bird settings, or their handpicked colors for use next time, they can save it under BOIDS SIMULATION. Users can select which settings they wish to include in the saved file, such as Appearance, Map Settings and Bird Settings. Users can then load the saved file under BOIDS SIMULATION as well.
I hope you have enjoyed this program as much as I did, and that it had helped you appreciate the beauty of bird movement, how complex behavior can arise from each bird following simple rules.
